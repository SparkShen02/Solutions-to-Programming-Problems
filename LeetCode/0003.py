class Solution:
    '''
    Use two pointers, one points to the start of current substring, and the other points just past the end of current substring. 
    Use a set (hash table) to store the characters that are in the current substring. Add a character to the set when the "end" pointer moves forward and remove a character from the set when the "start" pointer moves forward. 
    Time complexity: O(n), Space complexity: O(n).
