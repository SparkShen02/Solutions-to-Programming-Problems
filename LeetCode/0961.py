class Solution:
    '''
    One element appears n times, and all other elements appear just once. 
    Repeatedly, randomly choose two numbers and compare them. 
    The probability that the two numbers are equal = (n/2n) * ((n-1)/(2n-1)) â‰ˆ 1/4. So, we're expected to find the answer in about 4 trials. 
    Time complexity: big-O of random.randrange(), Space complexity: O(1).
